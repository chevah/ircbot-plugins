Development
-----------

If starting with a clean repo, install virtualenv and dev requirements::

    make deps

Virtual environment is created in `build/` folder.::

    . build/bin/activate

Run tests::
    make test
    or
    nosetests


Manual testing
--------------

Do all the tests in #chevah-test to not add noise to the main channel.

First you need to get the credentials, by placing the `client_id.json` in repo
root and then run.

    make irc-bot-oauth

You only need to get the credentials once.
After that you can launch the IRC bot::

    make run
